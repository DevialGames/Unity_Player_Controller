# Unity_Player_Controller
The C# code posted in this repo is a work in progress build of a custom kinematic player controller for Unity.

Latest Update 9/28/20: 
Removed redundant call to the player physics system
Redesign the input and state systems to be more flexible using interfaces instead of using concrete classes
Changed how the player's physics system operates to mitigate design issues that would have shown up later on in the project.

Update 8/25/20: Initial Code push, with some of the basic functionalities of a player controller
